# What is this? 
This is a simple project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Is Good project to **start learning React** üë∂üèª, the typical one when you start developing with a new library. Here you can find the common aspects of how to work with React. Don't search here a way to integrate services or clean architecture, because is just to understand the basics of React. 

It has just some test to see the basics of React testing library, but don't look for a nice testing path, in this time is just a basic testing to start.

It has a nice thing, you don't need to make a backend or use an external API, because there is a service called 'server', which you can store locally all your data. You can see information about this library at the [JSON server in npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

Hope you like it =)

## Available Scripts
Start running the local server: 
### `yarn server`

With this server, you simulate a backend. This server will be served at port 5000. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view what in the server is. 

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
